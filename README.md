HBase is most effectively used to store non-relational data, accessed via the HBase API. 
Apache Phoenix is commonly used as a SQL layer on top of HBase allowing you to use familiar SQL syntax to insert, delete, and query data stored in HBase.


Advantage: 
This type of distributed and non-relational databases presents a large storage capacity.
A table within HBase can consist of hundreds of millions of rows and millions of columns. HBase allows professionals to search for different versions, as well as historical data.
